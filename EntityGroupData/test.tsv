NotValid	We recently showed that the atypical PKC (aPKC) isozyme PKCiota is overexpressed in human <o> Disorders </o> (NSCLC) cells and that PKCiota plays a critical role in the transformed growth of the human <s> Anatomy </s> adenocarcinoma A549 cell line in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.

NotValid	In conclusion, the AM extract produced a very weak effect on the <s> Procedures </s> of <o> Disorders </o> induced by OVX and Ca deficiency in rats, but was similar to the results observed with alendronate.

NotValid	Cystitis, urethritis and pyelonephritis in cattle most commonly result from ascending urinary tract infection with Corynebacterium renale, Corynebacterium cystidis, <s> Living Beings </s> or <o> Living Beings </o>.
NotValid	Decades later, the discovery that estrogen plays a central role in this process eventually led to two important consequences: first, different modalities were developed to suppress or antagonize estrogen; and second, the ability to detect estrogen receptor in breast cancer tissue became a predictor of response to treatment--probably the best marker for <s> Physiology </s> among all <o> Disorders </o>.
NotValid	TTE correlated with TEE grading with an r = 0.42 (P = 0.0001) for patients (n = 75) with adequate <s> Procedures </s> and r = 0.32 (P = 0.001) for all <o> Living Beings </o> (n = 100), including those with suboptimal TTE images.
NotValid	Other, as yet, unapproved uses of TZDs include: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in which TZDs reduced <s> Anatomy </s> fat accumulation and improved liver function tests; polycystic ovary syndrome, where TZDs improved ovulation, hirsutism and endothelial dysfunction; and lipodystrophies, where TZDs increased body fat (marginally) and decrease <o> Disorders </o>.
NotValid	PAR-1 stimulation by <s> Chemicals and Drugs </s> also increased the formation of capillary-like structures by EPC in Matrigel, and this effect was abrogated by anti-CXCR-4, anti-SDF-1, and MEK <o> Chemicals and Drugs </o> pretreatment.
NotValid	Making these assumptions, we calculated that the diagnosis of either <s> Disorders </s> or Crohn's disease would have been made made correctly in 77 of our 88 patients (87.5 %), incorrectly in seven patients (8.0 %), and would not have been made in four <o> Living Beings </o> (4.5 %).
NotValid	To test this hypothesis, we investigated the combined effects of environmental conditions and <s> Physiology </s> on fitness in the self-<o> Physiology </o> snail Lymnaea stagnalis, using a stress gradient (0-2) applied to a 100 isolated and paired lineages: laboratory control (0), outdoor microcosm control (1) and pesticide exposure under outdoor microcosm conditions (2).
